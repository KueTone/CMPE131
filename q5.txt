Does the change inside increment_int_a change the variable a after the function call?

No it doesn't change as it is a value that is being passed and not the reference

Does the change inside increment_int_b change the variable b after the function call?

Yes

If they differ answer why? if not why not

The variable of 'a' is passing by variable, while 'b' is a list 
and the modifier edits the elemnt of the list and therefore passes by reference
